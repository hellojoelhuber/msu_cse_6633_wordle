# # Wordle 1/6 ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©
# ## Get the daily wordle on your first guess
# 
# You can get the daily [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) on the first try using the â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©  tweet distribution.
# 
# It turns out the â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©  squares taking social media by storm contain enough information to correctly guess the daily Wordle on the first attempt each day.
# 
# Weâ€™ll do this by taking a sample of several thousand tweets per daily Wordle. This sample is saved in the dataset [benhamner/wordle-tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/wordle-tweets). 
# 
# The Wordle source code contains 2,315 days of answers (all common 5-letter English words) and 10,657 other valid, less-common 5-letter English words.
# 
# We combine these to form a set of 12,972 possible words/answers.
# 
# We then simulate playing 3,500 Wordle games for each of these possible words, guessing based on the frequency of the word in the English language and the feedback received.
# 
# Then we take three measures to evaluate the observed distribution of â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©  squares on Twitter according to our valid words.
# 
# The first is the frequency of each of the 243 possible 5-square combinations in the observed/simulated games. We rank all the valid words by cosine similarity between the simulated and observed distributions.
# 
# The second looks at the fraction of these 5-square combinations that occur right before the correct guess. Again, we rank valid words based on the cosine similarity distance between the observed and simulated distributions.
# 
# Finally, based on the valid words thereâ€™s invalid 5-square combinations for each possible answer. We rank valid words on the number of these invalid combinations we observe. Twitter data being noisy, thereâ€™s usually some invalid combinations for the correct answer.
# 
# We then generate our guess by taking the word with the best average rank across these three measures.
# 
# Since I started collecting Twitter data (Wordle 210-222), this method generated the correct Wordle answer on the first attempt every day!
# 
# The code below uses Twitter data and precomputed simulation distributions to answer the dayâ€™s Wordle. It uses the daily Twitter data processed by the notebook [benhamner/pull-wordle-tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/pull-wordle-tweets). The notebook [benhamner/wordle-simulations](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/wordle-simulations) runs the Wordle simulations and precomputes invalid feedback square combinations.

# ### Assign each possible Wordle feedback result to a position in a vector
# 
# Wordle feedback results are five-character Unicode sequences like ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›â¬› (indicating the first letter is correct, the second letter is in the answer but in a different position, and the final three letters aren't in the answer) or ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ© (indicating you got all letters right and the answer).
# 
# For each of the five characters, you learn one of three things:
# 
# - ðŸŸ© - the letter is in the answer and in the correct position
# - ðŸŸ¨ - the letter is in the answer but in a different position
# - â¬› or â¬œ - the letter is not in the answer
# 
# This gives $3^5=243$ possible feedback results. We'll use 243-dimensional vector to capture these result distributions.
# 
# To move away from Unicode for simplicity, I reassign ðŸŸ© to Y (yes), ðŸŸ¨ to M (maybe), and â¬› / â¬œ to N (no).
# 
# Note that all of these 243 possibilities aren't valid in practice. For example YYYYM will never be seen because if the first four letters are correctly placed and the fifth is also in the word, it will be correctly placed. But we can ignore this edge case for our purpose.
